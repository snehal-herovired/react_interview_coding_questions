#REACT USEREF HOOK :==> https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches#referencing-values-with-refs
#From interview perspective , this hook is important as it defines uncontrolled component or uncontrolled input boxes in react.
 In general,when you handle input boxes and if you want to remember some values , it may trigger new renders or you may store the values of input boxes in their value 
 attributes, this case is generally in case controlled component or controlled input boxes where you modify the value attribute using useState hook.
 But this is not in case of UseRef hook, thats why it becomes interesting for interviewer to test you knowledge on UseRef hook.
